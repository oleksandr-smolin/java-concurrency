## **Intermediate Tasks** (Estimated Time: 20–40 hours from 1 to 7)

1. ### **Producer-Consumer Problem**
    - **Description**: Implement a bounded buffer where producers generate data and consumers process it.
    - **Estimated Time**: 3–4 hours

2. ### **Dining Philosophers Problem**
    - **Description**: Solve the classic synchronization problem using `Semaphore`.
    - **Estimated Time**: 3–4 hours

   #### Problem Overview
    - You have five philosophers sitting at a circular table.
    - Between each pair of philosophers is one chopstick (or fork), making a total of five chopsticks.
    - Each philosopher alternates between **thinking** and **eating**:
        - **Thinking**: A philosopher does not need any chopsticks and spends a random amount of time thinking.
        - **Eating**: A philosopher needs two chopsticks (the one on their left and the one on their right) and spends a
          random amount of time eating.
    - **Duration**:
        - Each philosopher spends a random time (e.g., 1 to 3 seconds) on both thinking and eating.
    - **Frequency**:
        - Philosophers continuously alternate between thinking and eating in a loop.
    - **Challenges**:
        - No two philosophers eat simultaneously using the same chopstick.
        - No philosopher starves (i.e., waits indefinitely to eat).


3. ### **Deadlock Demonstration**
    - **Description**: Create and resolve a deadlock scenario between two threads.
    - **Estimated Time**: 2–3 hours

4. ### **Read-Write Lock**
    - **Description**: Implement a read-write lock mechanism for shared resources.
    - **Estimated Time**: 3–4 hours

5. ### **Matrix Multiplication**
    - **Description**: Use multiple threads to compute matrix multiplication in parallel.
    - **Estimated Time**: 3–4 hours

6. ### **Parallel Search**
    - **Description**: Search for an element in a large array using multiple threads.
    - **Estimated Time**: 2–3 hours

7. ### **Word Count**
    - **Description**: Count word occurrences in a large text file using threads.
    - **Estimated Time**: 3–4 hours
