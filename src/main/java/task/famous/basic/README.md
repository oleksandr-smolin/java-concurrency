## **Basic Tasks**

### Order doesn't influence on difficulty 

1. **Print Numbers in Sequence Using Multiple Threads**
    - **Description**: Create three threads to print numbers sequentially (e.g., Thread-1 prints `1`, Thread-2 prints `2`, etc.).
    - **Estimated Time**: 1–2 hours

2. **Ping-Pong Task**
    - **Description**: Use two threads to alternately print "Ping" and "Pong".
    - **Estimated Time**: 1–2 hours

3. **Thread-safe Counter**
    - **Description**: Create a thread-safe counter.
    - **Estimated Time**: 1–2 hours

4. **Hello from Threads**
    - **Description**: Create five threads that each print a message like `"Hello from Thread-X"`, where X is the thread name or number.
    - **Estimated Time**: 15–30 minutes

5. **Sum of Elements with Threads**
    - **Description**: Divide an array into parts and compute the sum of each part using separate threads. Collect the total sum at the end.
    - **Estimated Time**: 1 hour

6. **Thread-safe Bank Account**
    - **Description**: Simulate deposit and withdrawal from a shared bank account using multiple threads. Prevent race conditions.
    - **Estimated Time**: 1–2 hours

7. **Odd-Even Printer**
    - **Description**: Use two threads to print odd and even numbers from 1 to 20 in correct sequence.
    - **Estimated Time**: 1–2 hours

8. **Interruptible Worker Thread**
    - **Description**: Create a worker thread that performs a loop and stops gracefully when interrupted.
    - **Estimated Time**: 30–60 minutes

9. **Thread Join Practice**
    - **Description**: Start multiple threads, ensure the main thread waits until they all finish using `join()`, and then print "All done".
    - **Estimated Time**: 30–60 minutes

10. **Simple Thread Pool with ExecutorService**
    - **Description**: Use a fixed thread pool to execute 10 simple tasks (like printing numbers). Ensure all tasks are completed before exit.
    - **Estimated Time**: 1 hour
