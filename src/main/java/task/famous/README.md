This README outlines a structured list of concurrency programming tasks to help you master multithreading, parallelism, and synchronization. Tasks are grouped into difficulty levels, and each section has its own numbering.

# Java Concurrency Tools

| **Tool/Utility**              | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`Thread`**                  | The basic unit of concurrent execution in Java.                                                                  |
| **`Runnable`**                | A functional interface for defining tasks to run on a `Thread`.                                                  |
| **`Callable`**                | Similar to `Runnable` but allows returning a result and throwing exceptions.                                     |
| **`Future`**                  | Represents the result of an asynchronous computation.                                                            |
| **`CompletableFuture`**       | Extends `Future`, enabling chaining and combining of asynchronous tasks.                                         |
| **`ExecutorService`**         | Manages and controls thread pools for executing tasks.                                                           |
| **`ForkJoinPool`**            | Optimized pool for dividing tasks into smaller subtasks (e.g., parallel streams).                                |
| **`Parallel Streams`**        | Provides easy parallelism for collections using `ForkJoinPool`.                                                  |
| **`Locks` (`ReentrantLock`)** | Advanced synchronization primitives for fine-grained control of critical sections.                               |
| **`ReadWriteLock`**           | Provides separate locks for read and write access to shared resources.                                           |
| **`Semaphore`**               | Controls access to a limited number of permits for shared resources.                                             |
| **`CountDownLatch`**          | Waits for a set number of threads to complete before proceeding.                                                 |
| **`CyclicBarrier`**           | Synchronizes threads at a common barrier point, reusable after threads pass the barrier.                         |
| **`Phaser`**                  | A more flexible version of `CyclicBarrier` for coordinating multiple phases of execution.                        |
| **`Atomic Classes`**          | (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, `AtomicReference`, etc.) for lock-free thread-safe operations on primitives.   |
| **`Volatile`**                | A lightweight synchronization mechanism for variables to ensure visibility across threads.                       |
| **`Synchronized`**            | A keyword to make methods or blocks thread-safe by acquiring intrinsic locks.                                    |
| **`Thread-Safe Collections`** | Built-in collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, and `BlockingQueue` for concurrent access. |

| **Collection**                 | **Description**                                                                                               |

| **`CopyOnWriteArraySet`**      | A thread-safe implementation of `Set` backed by a `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.                                      |
| **`BlockingQueue`**            | An interface for thread-safe queues that block on insertion or retrieval if the queue is full or empty.        |
| **`LinkedBlockingQueue`**      | A thread-safe queue implemented as a linked list, optionally bounded.                                          |

| **`PriorityBlockingQueue`**    | A thread-safe priority queue based on natural ordering or a comparator.                                        |
| **`DelayQueue`**               | A thread-safe queue that holds elements until they are eligible for processing based on a delay.               |
| **`SynchronousQueue`**         | A thread-safe queue where each insertion waits for a corresponding removal (and vice versa).                   |
| **`Deque` (`ConcurrentLinkedDeque`)** | A thread-safe double-ended queue for concurrent access.                                                          |
| **`ConcurrentLinkedQueue`**    | A thread-safe, unbounded queue implemented as a non-blocking linked list.                                       |
| **`TreeMap` (with `synchronizedMap`)**| A sorted map wrapped with `Collections.synchronizedMap` for thread safety.                                   |
| **`ThreadLocalRandom`**        | A thread-safe random number generator optimized for multithreaded environments.                                |

| **`Collections.synchronizedMap`** | A wrapper to make a regular map thread-safe by synchronizing access.                                          |
| **`Collections.synchronizedList`** | A wrapper to make a regular list thread-safe by synchronizing access.                                         |
