- **Requirements**:
  - **Request Handling**:
    - Simulate incoming requests using threads, with each request having a unique ID and payload.
    - Requests should be processed by backend servers via the load balancer.
  - **Backend Servers**:
    - Simulate a fixed number of backend servers (e.g., 5 servers).
    - Each server processes requests with a random delay (e.g., 50‚Äì500 ms).
    - Servers may occasionally fail to process a request, simulating downtime.
  - **Load Balancer Logic**:
    - Implement the following request distribution strategies:
      - **Round-Robin**: Assign requests sequentially to servers.
      - **Least Connections**: Assign requests to the server with the fewest active requests.
      - **Random**: Assign requests to servers randomly.
  - **Concurrency Handling**:
    - Use thread-safe mechanisms to distribute requests and manage server states (e.g., active connections).
    - Ensure no race conditions during request assignment.
